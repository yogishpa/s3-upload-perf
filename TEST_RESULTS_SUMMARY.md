## Cost Analysis

### Transfer Costs
- **S3 Transfer IN**: Free (Standard S3), $0.04/GB (Transfer Acceleration)
- **S3 Transfer OUT**: $0.09/GB (Standard S3), $0.13/GB (Transfer Acceleration)

### Cost for 3.01 GB File
- **Upload with Standard S3**: Free
- **Upload with Acceleration**: $0.12
- **Download with Standard S3**: $0.27
- **Download with Acceleration**: $0.39

### Cost Savings
Using optimized configuration without acceleration saves $0.24 per complete transfer (upload + download) of the 3.01 GB file.

## Connection Pool Analysis

During high-concurrency transfers, connection pool warnings were observed across multiple test methods:

```
Connection pool is full, discarding connection: s3-optimized-test-5e3fddb0.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

These warnings occurred most frequently with:
1. S3 CRT Client (both upload and download)
2. Optimized S3 with Acceleration (download)
3. Optimized S3 without Acceleration (download)

This suggests that the default connection pool size (50) may be a limiting factor for high-concurrency transfers. Increasing this value could potentially improve performance further, especially for download operations.

## Range GET Implementation Analysis

The Range GET implementation (23.89 MB/s) performed significantly worse than expected, being:
- 38.17% slower than Optimized S3 without Acceleration
- 37.48% slower than S3 CRT Client
- 12.14% slower than even Standard S3 Direct

Potential issues identified:
1. Suboptimal chunk size (currently using 25MB chunks)
2. Inefficient thread management
3. File writing bottlenecks
4. Excessive overhead in request coordination

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Optimize Range GET Implementation**:
   - Test different chunk sizes (10MB, 50MB, 100MB)
   - Implement more efficient file writing (memory mapping)
   - Improve thread pool management
   - Add adaptive concurrency based on available bandwidth

2. **Increase Connection Pool Size**:
   - Test with 75, 100, and 150 max connections
   - Monitor for diminishing returns

3. **Optimize Retry Strategy**:
   - Fine-tune adaptive retry mode parameters
   - Implement exponential backoff with jitter

4. **Network Optimization**:
   - Test with TCP window size adjustments
   - Evaluate performance with different EC2 instance types

5. **Regional Testing**:
   - Compare performance across different AWS regions
   - Test cross-region transfers with and without acceleration
